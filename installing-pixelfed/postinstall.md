## Import Places Data
Run the following command after installation to import the Places data.

```bash
php artisan import:cities
```

## Webserver Configuration

To translate HTTPS web requests to PHP workers, you will need to configure a reverse proxy.

### Apache
Pixelfed includes a `public/.htaccess` file that is used to provide URLs without the index.php front controller in the path. Before serving Pixelfed with Apache, be sure to enable the `mod_rewrite` module in your Apache configuration so the `.htaccess` file will be honored by the server.

If the `.htaccess` file that ships with Pixelfed does not work with your Apache installation, try this alternative:

```php
Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

To use Apache as a reverse proxy you'll need something like the following:

```php
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName pixelfed.example.com

    # Notify the server that the connection is secure
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass "/" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
    ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

    Include path_to_ssl_conf_file
    SSLCertificateFile path_to_cert_file
    SSLCertificateKeyFile path_to_cert_key_file
</VirtualHost>
```

Note that without setting the request headers image upload previews will appear broken.

### Nginx

Pixelfed includes a sample NGINX configuration at `contrib/nginx.conf`. You can copy the contents of this file or include it within your `nginx.conf`. Take note of the comments, and make sure to set the correct domain name and root path.

```nginx{4,5,7,8,33,36,45}
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name pixelfed.example;                    # change this to your fqdn
    root /home/pixelfed/public;                      # path to repo/public

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;       # generate your own
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;   # or use letsencrypt

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EECDH+CHACHA20:EECDH+AES;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock; # make sure this is correct
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; # or $request_filename
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}

server {                                             # Redirect http to https
    server_name pixelfed.example;                    # change this to your fqdn
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

::: tip FastCGI path
Make sure to use the correct `fastcgi_pass` socket path for your distribution and version of PHP-FPM. For example, on Arch, this is `/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock`, but on Ubuntu it may be `/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock`, on Debian it may be `/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock`, and so on. If you have configured a PHP server over TCP, you may also pass to its IP and port, e.g. `localhost:9000` by default.
:::

::: tip Nginx web root
Make sure to use the `/public` folder as your server root. Example:`server {root /var/www/pixelfed/public;)`.
If you set root to the install directory (example: `server {root /var/www/pixelfed;)` Pixelfed will not work.

### HTTPS Certificate

For local development, you may generate a self-signed SSL certificate. For example:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt
```

For production deployments, you will need to obtain a certificate from a certificate authority. You may automate certification from LetsEncrypt, a free certificate authority, by using a utility such as [EFF Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) or [acme.sh](https://acme.sh).


### SystemD

To run Pixelfed on startup using systemd you can add a service for it:

Create: `/etc/systemd/system/pixelfed.service` with:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Pixelfed

[Service]
User=pixelfed
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php ~/pixelfed/artisan serve

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

and enable it with `sudo systemctl enable pixelfed.service`

Similarly for queue workers:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Pixelfed queue workers

[Service]
User=pixelfed
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php ~/pixelfed/artisan queue:work --daemon --env=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
